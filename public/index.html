    <h1>Stop Bullying — Stand Together</h1>
    <p>
      Bullying is a behavior where someone, alone or in a group, intentionally tries to hurt another person physically or emotionally. It is often repeated and involves a power imbalance.  [oai_citation:14‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
    </p>
    <p>Types of bullying include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical: hitting, pushing, kicking, pinching.  [oai_citation:15‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) </li>
      <li>Verbal: teasing, threatening, spreading rumors.  [oai_citation:16‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) </li>
      <li>Relational: ignoring, excluding someone from a group.  [oai_citation:17‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) </li>
      <li>Property: destroying or hiding someone’s belongings.  [oai_citation:18‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) </li>
      <li>Cyber: using social media, posting hurtful messages or videos.  [oai_citation:19‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Bullying affects not only the victim, but also the bully and those who witness it.  [oai_citation:20‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      Victims may feel powerless, lose self-esteem, suffer from anxiety or depression, or even consider self-harm.  [oai_citation:21‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      Bullies themselves may act out due to low self-esteem, stress, or the need for control and recognition.  [oai_citation:22‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bystanders — those who see bullying happen — can unintentionally encourage it. Some learn that “power means respect,” and this cycle grows.  [oai_citation:23‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    </p>

    <h2>How to Help & Prevent Bullying</h2>
    <p>Everyone — both children and adults — must understand that bullying is serious. It’s not just “kids being kids.”  [oai_citation:24‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Listen to children who report being bullied. Encourage them. Don’t dismiss them as “telling tales.”  [oai_citation:25‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Ask about what happened: who, where, how. Use this to plan support.  [oai_citation:26‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Teach assertiveness: help children say, “I don’t like how you treat me.”  [oai_citation:27‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>If bullying continues: convene talks with everyone involved — victims, bullies, and witnesses — plus parents and teachers.  [oai_citation:28‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Promote “buddy systems”: encourage children to support each other so no one is alone.  [oai_citation:29‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Foster empathy: encourage children to consider how others feel. “If that were me …” helps build understanding.  [oai_citation:30‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>For children with emotional or behavioral struggles (like low self-esteem or ADHD), connect them to a mental health professional.  [oai_citation:31‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Caring for Yourself (When You’re Being Bullied)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid high-risk environments if possible. Stay safe.  [oai_citation:32‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Use “I‑messages” to express how you feel. E.g., “When you say that, I feel hurt.”  [oai_citation:33‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Record evidence: save messages, take pictures, write down what happened.  [oai_citation:34‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Tell someone you trust. Share what you’re going through, don’t suffer alone.  [oai_citation:35‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>Remember: being bullied is not your fault. You deserve respect and help.  [oai_citation:36‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
      <li>If things get too hard — talk to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor.  [oai_citation:37‡manarom.com](https://www.manarom.com/blog/stop_bullying.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
